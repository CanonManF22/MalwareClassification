# MalwareClassification
Abstract—​​ Metamorphic malware is almost undetectable when it comes to traditional signature protection due to their polymorphic tendencies, but made possible using machine learning techniques. Here, we’ll apply a combination of Hidden Markov Models with other machine learning techniques in an attempt to detect and properly classify Malware into their appropriate families. We’ll be extracting static opcode sequences of our data and running it through an HMM.
Taking the data, we’ll experiment with several different analysis methods and compare results to determine the most appropriate approach for such a task.
